# RayTracer

This is a raytracer built from scratch using the SDL2 library. It is made entirely in C++ and has two build files.
First is a reference that shows different rendering techniques and material examples. 
This raytracer includes back and front-face culling as well as various lighting methods and materials.
The other example is using the Standford bunny model as a way to benchmark the optimization of the engine.
The goal was to be able to render the bunny with as many FPS as possible employing various methods of optimization.
